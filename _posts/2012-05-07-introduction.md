Hi, I am Vipin. I am a generalist in the technology field, interested in everything from algorithm design to data visualization. I am [Free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) advocate and only use FOSS tools unless absolutely required, one notable exception being Chrome. I run [Debian](http://www.debian.org) as my primary(only) operating system and will be contributing to Debian this summer as a Google Summer of Code student. I will be developing a web interface to present the data collected by the [Team Activity Metrics](http://teammetrics.alioth.debian.org/) project. More on this later :)

After a brief stint with tumblr and wordpress I have finally found a [good blogging tool](http://jekyllrb.com) where I am in complete control of every minute detail of my blog and which fits in my workflow perfectly. I am not a ruby guy, which is probably one of the reasons why I had not tried Jekyll earlier but when Jaseem started his blog on github, it looked great and I ventured in. The design of this blog is inspired by those of [Jaseem Abid](http://jaseemabid.github.com) and [Dustin Curtis](http://dcurt.is) and I do recommend that you read them, they have some great articles. 

If you are getting started with Jekyll, the best way to do so would be by reading some existing [open source code](http://github.com/swvist/swvist.github.com/), assuming you have a top level overview of how things work. Read the documentation if you can't figure it out yourself. Trust me, the hacker in you will love it :)

Blogs are great place to learn new stuff and whenever I am stuck, a quick search does lead me to articles lucidly explaining stuff I am looking for and I do think I can contribute to this learning process by writing articles that could benefit someone. Do share it if you find it good, I certainly do not mind getting slashdotted! Having said that, if you find flaws in my writings please do drop in a line as a comment or reach me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/swvist). Do not flame me, educate me. I'll learn something new and your karma gets a boost :)

**Happy Hacking!**
