We learn to code by actually writing code and we did it because we enjoyed it.
Now it is my day job and I get to do it a lot more. The only difference being
its a lot more Java now.

[Jaseem](http://jaseemabid.github.io) and I have decided to take up a pet
project of ours and finish it in a week. Jaseem is writing Conway's Game of Life
in Elisp and I will be implementing a single player AI powered Reversi game in
Erlang.

I have been learning and writing Erlang for some time now it is something I
enjoy. I believe actor model is one of the best ways to express concurrency
primitives and the functional way of things is
[beautiful](http://xkcd.com/1270/) in itself, but I digress.

Back in college we used to write code because it was something we enjoyed. Now
there is not much that I write, apart from what I do at my day job, and this is
an exercise in bringing those glory days back.

Now read about this in [his words](http://jaseemabid.github.io/10-05-2013/hacker-at-heart.html).
