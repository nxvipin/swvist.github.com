Whenever I have mentioned Erlang to students here, most of them haven't even heard of such a language. I had given a Seminar on Concurrent Programming in Erlang hoping to get some people interested in this language though I am not aware of anyone working on this after the seminar. I almost convinced one guy but then he found pthreads much easier :(

Anyways the [presentation](http://www.rvl.io/swvist/concurrent-programming-with-erlang) is available online. Click on the full screen button and follow the arrows, the slides are bidirectional.

Also, I might propose a talk/hands-on session on this at [FOSSMeet 2013](http://fossmeet.in/2013/).

PS : Being the Debian fan boy that I am, I have to mention this even though it is irrelevant to the article. We have [Mini DebConf](http://fossmeet.in/2013/content/mini-debconf) at FOSSMeet this year. Now excuse me!
